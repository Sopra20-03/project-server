# Just One Game Server (FS 20 Group 3)

## Introduction

(here: the projects aim)

Just One is a cooperative board game for 3 to 7 players consisting of 13 rounds. In each round of the game, one of the players plays the role of a ‘guesser’, while the remaining players play the role of ‘clue writers’. The round’s guesser arbitrarily chooses a number which corresponds to a mystery word without taking a look at the word. The other players, ‘clue writers’, write down a one world clue for the round’s guesser who must figure out the mystery word based on the clues provided. But before the clues are given to the ‘guesser’, all duplicates are removed and thus the game becomes more interesting as giving clues which are too obvious may lead to backfire.

Our project, titled ‘Just One Game’, is a web implementation of the same board game and our aim is to provide a similar experience to the players from the comfort of their home. Modern web technology allows us to integrate more immersive and collaborative features which not only make the gameplay experience more enjoyable but also allows for the community to grow as players can challenge each other to games and keep track of scores on the leaderboard.
